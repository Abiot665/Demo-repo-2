        <p style="padding-left: 5px;">In February 2014, creative director Neil Druckmann said the possibility of a sequel to the The Last of Us was "about 50/50", and the team needed to develop a story "really worth telling, and that's not repeating itself". In July 2014, community strategist Arne Meyer said that not considering a sequel "would be a disservice" to the studio and the fans. 

            In December 2014, character artist Michael Knowland who previously worked with Naughty Dog on <span> The Last of Us </span> updated his LinkedIn page to include <span> The Last of Us 2</span> with him as the lead character artist who was designing head sculpts. Shortly afterwards his page was updated to remove all mention of the sequel.
            
            At MetroCon 2015 in June, Nolan North, who portrays David in <span>The Last of Us</span> and Nathan Drake in the Uncharted series, was asked if he was involved in any future Naughty Dog projects. He replied "For now, <span>Uncharted 4</span> is the last one. I know they're doing <span>The Last of Us 2</span>, but my character in <span>The Last of Us</span> kind of met an untimely demise". Druckmann later responded to North's comments, saying that a small team at Naughty Dog had explored ideas and begun building prototypes for a sequel, but were interrupted when the team shifted their focus to development of <span>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</span>. 
            
            Rumors briefly rose again after an Easter egg referring to <span>The Last of Us </span> appeared in <span>Uncharted 4's</span> denouement specifically a picture of a pregnant woman resembling Ellie with the title <span>The Last of Us: American Daughters</span> next to it.

            <p style="padding-left: 5px;"> The trailer opens with a sequence of five shots of a forested area. The rusty remains of an abandoned vehicle and a tree with claw marks in its trunk are shown as the camera pans outwards. Some run-down houses then appear in the foreground, before an old 'Stop' road sign with the Firefly logo graffitied on it comes into view. 
                
                Then the scene changes to <span>Ellie</span> sat on a bed, tuning and subsequently playing an acoustic guitar as she sings Through the Valley by Shawn James. The next shot reveals a tattoo on her arm as the camera cuts around the room, showing among many other things an open window to <span>Ellie</span>'s left. Some have noted the resemblance between this window and the window depicted on the main menu screen of the original game. 
                
                While the music continues, a male figure enters through the front door. Initially nothing more than a silhouette, the man walks through the house with a revolver in his right hand, taking stock of the several dead bodies littered in the building, implied to have been killed by <span>Ellie</span>. None of the bodies show obvious signs of infection by the CBI from the original game. 
                
                The man eventually enters <span>Ellie</span>'s room, and the camera angle then reveals his identity: <span>Joel</span>. The pair exchange the following dialogue:<br>

                <span>Joel</span>: "What are you doing, kiddo? You really gonna go through with this?"<br>
                <span>Ellie</span>: "I'm gonna find... and I'm gonna kill... every last one of them."<br>
                The trailer ends on a closeup of Ellie's face before fading-in the title<span>The Last of Us Part II</span>.<br>
